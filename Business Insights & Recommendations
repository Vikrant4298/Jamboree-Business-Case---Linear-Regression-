# Business Insights & Recommendations
# Insights:
• First column was observed as unique row identifier which was dropped and was not required for model building

• University Rating , SOP and LOR strength and research are seems to be discrete random Variables , but also ordinal numeric data.

• All the other features are numeric, ordinal and continuous.

• No null values were present in data.

• No Significant amount of outliers were found in data.sChance of admission(target variable) and GRE score(an independent feature) are nearly normally distribted.

• Independent Variables (Input data): GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research

• Target/Dependent Variable : Chance of Admit (the value we want to predict)

• From correlation heatmap , we can observe GRE score, TOEFL score and CGPA have very high correlation with Change of admission.

• University rating, SOP ,LOR and Research have comparatively slightly less correlated than other features.

• Chances of admit is a probability measure , which is within 0 to 1 which is good (no outliers or missleading data in column).

• Range of GRE score looks like between 290 to 340.

• Range of TOEFL score is between 92 to 120

• University rating , SOP and LOR are distributed between range of 1 to 5.

• CGPA range is between 6.8 to 9.92.

• From boxplots (distribution of chance of admition (probability of getting admition) as per GRE score ) : with higher GRE score , there is high probability of getting an admission.

• Students having high toefl score , has higher probability of getting admission.

• From count plots, we can observe , statement of purpose SOP strength is positively correlated with Chance of Admission.

• We can also similar pattern in Letter of Recommendation Stength and University rating , have positive correlation with Chaces of Admission.

• Student having research has higher chances of Admission , but also we can observe some outliers within that category.

# Model Predictors:
Our analysis identified several key predictors strongly correlated with admission chances.

Notably, GRE score, TOEFL score, and CGPA emerged as significant factors influencing admission probabilities.

Multicollinearity Check:
Assessing multicollinearity revealed no significant issues, indicating the robustness of our model despite high correlations among predictors.

Model Performance: Both Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models exhibited promising performance, capturing up to approximentally 82% of the variance in admission probabilities.

Data Distribution: Exploratory data analysis uncovered left-skewed distributions in admission probabilities and strong positive correlations between exam scores and admission chances.

# Recommendations:
Feature Enhancement:
Encourage students to focus on improving GRE scores, CGPA, and the quality of Letters of Recommendation (LOR), as these factors significantly influence admission chances.

# Data Augmentation:
Collect a wider range of data beyond academic metrics to capture applicants’ holistic profiles, including extracurricular achievements, personal statements, and diversity factors.

# Additional Features:
Given the strong correlation among CGPA, we can enrich the predictive model with additional diverse features such as Research, work experience, internships, or extracurricular activities.
